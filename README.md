## A Boundary Regression Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition

Paper Link：https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14330

**Abstract**：Recognizing named entities (NEs) is commonly implemented as a classification task that predicts a class tag for each NE candidate in a sentence. In a shallow structure, the decision boundary is learned from categorized features. Recent developments in neural networks adopt deep structures that map categorized features into continuous representations. This approach unfolds a dense space for word representations saturated with abstract semantic information. In this paper, this idea is further extended to adopt continuous position representation for NE boundaries. This extension catalyses a breakthrough for NE recognition, in which a regression operation is introduced to locate NEs in a sentence. This results in two advantages for NE recognition. **First**, locating NEs by boundary regression can resolve the nesting NE problem. **Second**, taking position parameters as supervision signs for training can make full use of annotated data. A multiobjective learning framework is designed based on boundary regression, which simultaneously predicts the class probability and locates nested NEs in a sentence. By sharing parameters for locating and predicting, this framework enables more potent nonlinear function approximators to enhance model discriminability. Experiments demonstrate state-of-theart performance for nested named entities.
